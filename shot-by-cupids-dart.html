                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This romantic pop lyric, "shot by cupids dart," captures the whimsical and sudden nature of falling in love. Using the classic imagery of Cupid, the narrative describes a protagonist who is "blinded" by love and finds a deep, enduring connection. The lyrics are playful and sincere, emphasizing a "together forever" commitment. This asset provides a charming, lighthearted foundation for music supervisors seeking romantic soundtracks or bedroom pop placements for scenes centered on new love.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Romantic comedy "meet-cute" sequence 2. Soundtrack for a blossoming relationship 3. Lighthearted bedroom pop sync placement</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
