    <h1>BIG HARD NO</h1>

    <p>So sad, heard she had enough, "don't want ya anymore," and you're taking it rough</p>
    <p>That's too bad, I know what you're going through, yeah, it's tough</p>
    <p>Now you're here, with that sad look on your face,</p>
    <p>Trying to get back in my good grace</p>
    <p>You wanna apologize? Talkin' 'bout a second chance?</p>
    <p>Honestly, I'm past that desperate dance</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus)</h2>
    <p>Look, the answer on my face screams "hell no,"</p>
    <p>But let me say it real clear before I go</p>

    <h2>(Chorus)</h2>
    <p>'Cause that's a big hard no, not playing your game!</p>
    <p>Nothing you could whisper can ever douse this flame</p>
    <p>You can't mess with my day, no way, not anymore!</p>
    <p>So move on, I'm closing this door!</p>

    <p>You think I'm dumb, said it yourself, 'cause I didn't know you had someone else</p>
    <p>You think I'm weak, no x-ray eyes, couldn't see through your disguise</p>
    <p>Lemme tell ya, you're wrong</p>
    <p>Maybe I wasn't strong, but I knew it all along</p>
    <p>Ooh, and still stayed Hopin' it would change But it didn't go my way</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <p>You say you're sorry, 'cause it happened to you, now you understand?</p>
    <p>But I remember all the times I held your stiff, cold hand</p>
    <p>I got my reasons, etched within my soul,</p>
    <p>You left me shattered, lost all control</p>
    <p>For someone else, you walked right out the door,</p>
    <p>Left me calling out your name, as I lay crying on the floor</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Outro)</h2>
    <p>I'm happier now, more than I've ever been</p>
    <p>Found my own light, a peace from deep within</p>
    <p>My desire in something bigger, and better, guiding me,</p>
    <p>I'm glad I'm finally free</p>
    <p>There's nothing you could say, no magic spell,</p>
    <p>My story's written, and you don't fit in it well</p>
    <p>No, you don't fit in it well</p>
    <p>Yeah, you're wrong, I'm not weak, I've grown strong</p>
    <p>Happier now, more than ever there's no us Can't tempt me, devil, I love Jesus</p>
