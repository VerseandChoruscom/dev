    <h1>BIG HARD NO</h1>

    <p>So sad, heard she had enough, "don't want ya anymore," and you're taking it rough</p>
    <p>That's too bad, I know what you're going through, yeah, it's tough</p>
    <p>Now you're here, with that sad look on your face,</p>
    <p>Trying to get back in my good grace</p>
    <p>You wanna apologize? Talkin' 'bout a second chance?</p>
    <p>Honestly, I'm past that desperate dance</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus)</h2>
    <p>See, I’ve been building my own world, piece by piece</p>
    <p>Finding a peace of mind that'll never cease</p>
    <p>I’m finally breathing, finally standing tall</p>
    <p>And I’m not about to let you make me fall</p>

    <h2>(Chorus)</h2>
    <p>So it’s a big hard no, a final goodbye</p>
    <p>No more excuses, no more asking why</p>
    <p>I’ve closed that door and I’ve locked it tight</p>
    <p>I’m moving forward, into the light</p>
    <p>Yeah, it’s a big hard no, can’t you see?</p>
    <p>There’s no more room for you and me</p>

    <h2>(Verse 2)</h2>
    <p>You think you can just walk back in, like nothing ever changed</p>
    <p>But the girl you knew is gone, and everything’s rearranged</p>
    <p>I was blind, no x-ray eyes, couldn't see through your disguise</p>
    <p>Lemme tell ya, you're wrong</p>
    <p>Maybe I wasn't strong, but I knew it all along</p>
    <p>Ooh, and still stayed Hopin' it would change But it didn't go my way</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <p>You say you're sorry, 'cause it happened to you, now you understand?</p>
    <p>But I remember all the times I held your stiff, cold hand</p>
    <p>I got my reasons, etched within my soul,</p>
    <p>You left me shattered, lost all control</p>
    <p>For someone else, you walked right out the door,</p>
    <p>Left me calling out your name, as I lay crying on the floor</p>

    <h2>(Pre-chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

    <h2>(Outro)</h2>
    <p>I'm happier now, more than I've ever been</p>
    <p>Found my own light, a peace from deep within</p>
    <p>My desire in something bigger, and better, guiding me,</p>
    <p>I'm glad I'm finally free</p>
    <p>There's nothing you could say, no magic spell,</p>
    <p>My story's written, and you don't fit in it well</p>
    <p>No, you don't fit in it well</p>
    <p>It's a big hard no</p>
