                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This cinematic pop/rock anthem, "the back of me," explores a powerful empowerment arc centered on a decisive exit from a toxic or stagnant relationship. The narrative captures the moment of finality, where the protagonist stops pleading and instead chooses self-respect. With a tone that shifts from vulnerability to defiant strength, the lyrics emphasize the silence that follows a departure and the "one last frame" of moving on. This asset is ideal for music supervisors seeking a high-impact foundation for final breakup sequences or empowered character exits.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Final breakup "walking away" sequence 2. Empowered character exit 3. Dramatic cinematic ending 4. Strong pop/rock soundtrack</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Stop before you go too far now there's no turning back</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You better change your direction you've got to reverse the whole track</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I almost just said which drawer your favorite shirt is kept</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">While my heart is hurting watching you pack</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You aren't giving us enough time to fix this oh no</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Pre Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You don't know what it could have been would have been</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">We’re burning down a house we haven't finished building yet</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I don't need to chase new lovers now</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You should not walk out the door should not give up on us not now</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You should not stick with this plan I don't know what to say or do</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I just don't understand why you aren't fighting for us</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But I don't want to make a huge fuss I'm doing the best that I can</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You’re so wrong it’s a bad idea really</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Destroying us is the heart of your plan</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You won't have me no no no</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And I won't come running and all you will see is the back of me when you leave</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Having both is a lie a scam</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">If it’s space you desire to be alone in your room I’ll be quiet</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I can give you that and more I can even silence a riot</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">It’ll hit you hard when your facade's disintegrating</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">When the mask you’re wearing starts to crack and fray</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause that head held high and that confidence you're feeling inside is an illusion created</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A mere imitation of a man I made you by building you up and never complaining</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And what’s left is the fact that this broken-spirited man who lacks won't have me back and all he can see is the back of me</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Stop you think I'll be here when you return a statue carved in tears</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">That I'll unpack the hope you crushed and dry away my little fears</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You're banking on my weakness on a love you can abuse</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Well the story ends right now and it's a chapter you will lose</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm done waiting for a sign for a choice you won't commit to</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">My patience is the door that I am walking straight right through</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You wanted space fine you can have the whole damn room</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But when I'm gone that silence will feel like a tomb</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">All you will see when you turn back to look is the back of me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The whisper of my coat sleeve the echo of my sole walking through and shutting the door</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The sound is so deafening that it swallows up your whole silly selfish dream of having it all</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And then you're left there standing alone not getting me anymore</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just that one last frame the back of me and yourself to blame</h3>
