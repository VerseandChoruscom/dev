  <div class="song-label">Verse 1</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">The ties that bound us they've come undone. Betrayed and hurt the trust is gone. No use in trying there's no repair. Just relax now don't you dare. Try to fix it it's too far gone. Too much crying since the early morn'. Too much fighting too much disrespect. Too much lying no truth to detect. Too much blame and too much shame. For all the damage we can't reclaim.</div>
