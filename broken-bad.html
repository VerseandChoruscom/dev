        <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
        <p>The ties that bound us, they've come undone</p>
        <p>Betrayed and hurt, the trust is gone</p>
        <p>No use in trying, there's no repair</p>
        <p>Just relax now, don't you dare</p>
        <p>Try to fix it, it's too far gone</p>
        <p>Too much crying since the early morn'</p>
        <p>Too much fighting, too much disrespect</p>
        <p>Too much lying, no truth to detect</p>
        <p>Too much blame, and too much shame</p>
        <p>For all the damage, we can't reclaim</p>

    <section class="lyrics-block">
        <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
        <p>Too many tears shed through the years</p>
        <p>Drowning our sorrow, stifling fears</p>
        <p>Too many days with too many beers</p>
        <p>Washing away what disappears</p>
        <p>Didn't look forward to another sunrise</p>
        <p>Just loneliness reflected in our eyes</p>

        <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
        <p>Too much fighting, too much disrespect</p>
        <p>Too much lying, no truth to detect</p>
        <p>Too much blame, and too much shame</p>
        <p>For all the damage, we can't reclaim</p>

    <section class="lyrics-block">
        <h2>(BRIDGE)</h2>
        <p>Just too much, and just too many</p>
        <p>Bad memories that haunt, a broken touch</p>
        <p>Feelings of distrust, a heavy cost</p>
        <p>Everything we built, completely lost</p>
