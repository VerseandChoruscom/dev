                            **Kellie Larson** is a lyricist and cinematic storyteller known for crafting emotionally raw, narrative-driven lyrics with a focus on **sync-ready content** for film, television, and advertising. She specializes in excavating the complex, high-stakes themes of modern life—from the volatile edges of toxic relationships and the fight against addiction to profound experiences of loss and the ultimate journey toward self-reclamation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her portfolio is specifically designed to meet the demands of the B2B music industry, emphasizing **Genre, Mood, and Use/Occasion** metadata for quick licensing placement. Her writing is characterized by high-concept narratives, vivid emotional detail, and an overarching journey toward empowerment. Her writing has been compared to artists who embody raw emotion and intimate storytelling, such as **Adele** and **Ed Sheeran**, with a capacity for the dark introspection often found in **Billie Eilish**.

                        <h3>Behind the Pen</h3>

                        <p>
                            A self-described "mother of two beautiful daughters," Kellie’s approach to songwriting is deeply therapeutic. Her lyrical journey began with poetry written since elementary school, evolving into full songs often written to process significant life events. This includes the poignant experience of losing both parents in close succession, which led to her first written song, **“Oh My Love,”** a funeral-style ballad written while supporting her family through grief. This personal history of resilience is the authentic core of her emotional narratives.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Professionally, Kellie brings the discipline of a seasoned **Executive Assistant and Retail/Project Manager** to her art. Her 25+ years of experience in administrative, retail management, and event logistics—skills that require **critical thinking, meticulous planning, and rigorous attention to detail**—are directly applied to her creative business. She approaches songwriting not just as a creative outlet but as a **professional, client-focused business**.
