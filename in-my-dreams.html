                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> "in my dreams" is a poignant, cinematic lyric that captures the bittersweet interplay between grief and memory. The narrative transitions from the vivid, colorful reunions of the dream world to the stark, "gray" reality of waking life. With visceral lines like "these tears don't stop" and the haunting echo of a called name, it explores the deep longing to remain in a space where a loved one is still present. This asset is an evocative choice for music supervisors needing a high-emotion track for scenes of loss, remembrance montages, or a character's internal struggle with a "watery grave" of memories.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Emotional remembrance montage 2. Character-driven scene exploring grief 3. Final goodbye/closure sequence 4. Melancholic, reflective cinematic soundtrack</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
