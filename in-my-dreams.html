    <p><strong>Title: In My Dreams</strong><br>Copyright: @2025 Kellie Larson<br>Genre 1 & 2: Easy Listening, Pop, Sub Genre: Love Song, Mood(s): Melancholic, Dreamy Theme(s): Loss, Grief, Placement(s): Funeral Scene, Romantic Drama</p>
    <p>Snippet: In my dreams - I long to be - together in my dreams</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in this Lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna [Standard Licensing Applied].</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This cinematic lyric explores the deep psychological landscape of grief and the sanctuary found within the subconscious. The narrative arc follows a protagonist navigating the stark contrast between a vibrant dream world where a loved one still exists and the gray, lonely reality of waking life. It captures the sensory details of memory—the feeling of hair tucked behind ears and the warmth of a gaze—to create an immersive emotional experience for the listener. The lyrics emphasize the universal human desire to transcend physical absence through the power of the mind, making it a high-value asset for sync placements in heavy dramatic montages or episodic finales dealing with loss. The storytelling is raw, vulnerable, and focused on the transition from heartbreak to a bittersweet acceptance, providing a poetic framework for a&r reps seeking resonant, human-centric narratives that anchor a soundtrack with genuine emotional weight and lasting impact.</p>
    <p>This would be best: 1. Period drama bereavement montage 2. Emotional climax in a streaming series 3. Memorial tribute sequence 4. Indie film exploration of memory</p>

    <h2>In My Dreams</h2>
    <div class="lyrics-container">
        <div class="label-h2">(Verse)</div>
        <h3>In my dreams, you are here, and you kiss my cheek<br>As you tuck the hair behind my ears<br>Then hold me tight, as we gaze into each other's eyes<br>But when I wake, you're not here, and I feel loneliness and fear<br>Emptiness engulfs me, and I long for your embrace</h3>
        <div class="label-h2">(Pre Chorus)</div>
        <h3>When I wake, I swear sometimes I hear you call my name<br>But when I turn to see your face, there's nothing but empty space</h3>
        <div class="label-h2">(Chorus)</div>
        <h3>In my dreams - I long to be - together in my dreams<br>In my dreams - it will have to be - I see you in my dreams</h3>
        <div class="label-h2">(Verse)</div>
        <h3>In my dreams, everything is right, and you're never ever out of my sight<br>You smile big when I laugh, and you get behind me when I dance<br>But when I wake, everything is gray, all the world's colors seem to fade<br>I cry a lot, these tears don't stop, and it's hard to get through my day</h3>
        <div class="label-h2">(Pre Chorus Repeats)</div>
        <div class="label-h2">(Chorus Repeats)</div>
        <div class="label-h2">(Bridge)</div>
        <h3>When dreams take hold, I don't want to leave my bed<br>When waking comes, I wish I stayed dreaming instead<br>I ask God to take this pain<br>Till we can be together again</h3>
        <div class="label-h2">(Outro)</div>
        <h3>In my dreams - just you and me<br>In my dreams - we are free<br>In my dreams - it will have to be<br>I will see you in my dreams<br>In my dreams is where you'll be</h3>
