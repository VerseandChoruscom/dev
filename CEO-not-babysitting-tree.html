    <h1>(TITLE: CEO NOT BABYSITTING TREE)</h1>

    <h2>(INTRO)</h2>
    <p>Boys I don't want no boys I don't have time for</p>
    <p>Sighs dramatically</p>
    <p>Seriously like are you lost Did your mom pack your lunch</p>
    <p>Cause I ain't got time for tantrums what you have for breakfast lemme guess Cap'n Crunch</p>
    <p>you're texting me with emojis and asking if I'm free</p>
    <p>Honey I'm a CEO not a babysitting tree</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>Boys boys boys boys boys boys boys boys boys</p>
    <p>Please take your tiny hearts and find some other toys</p>
    <p>I need a man who knows his way around a dinner date</p>
    <p>Not someone asking to chill at my crib cause their parents are still awake at 8 PM</p>
    <p>Like seriously When's your bedtime dude</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>you're flexing muscles in your selfies with a pouty little face</p>
    <p>While I'm hustling racking stacks running a fast-paced race</p>
    <p>you think a like is foreplay Honey you're so wrong</p>
    <p>I need a man who whispers sweet nothings all night long</p>
    <p>Not wyd at 2 AM with a picture of your feet</p>
    <p>I'm busy dreaming of a man with a sensual sweet heat</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS REPEATS)</h2>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>I need a man who knows his way around a dinner date</p>
    <p>He opens all doors turns the heater on to keep me warm and calls if he is going to be late</p>
    <p>Not a boy who doesnt show and sends a my bad the next day</p>
    <p>A real man values my time when he makes plans with me he keeps them</p>
    <p>you're asking for my Snapchat Darling I used that back in the day</p>
    <p>Call me over and hand me a controller No I dont wanna play</p>

    <h2>(BRIDGE)</h2>
    <p>I need a man who can fix a sink and then fix me you know</p>
    <p>A little bit of dirty talk and a really strong glow</p>
    <p>I need a man who knows his wine and knows just how to tease</p>
    <p>Not someone asking are you sure when I'm begging on my knees</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS REPEATS)</h2>

    <h2>(OUTRO)</h2>
    <p>Boys bless their little hearts they just don't understand</p>
    <p>I need a man who's got the goods and a confident strong hand</p>
    <p>So boys go play your video games cause your not in a real womens league</p>
    <p>you think the proper way to behave is to have a women wait while you get to the next town so you can save</p>
