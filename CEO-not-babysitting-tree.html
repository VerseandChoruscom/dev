  <div class="lyric-line">I don't need a boy who needs a map to find his own way home. I need a man with a vision and a throne. Not a little boy who still needs his mama's hand. I'm a queen in my castle ruling over my land. You're looking for a babysitter well that's not me. I'm a CEO and I'm growing my own tree. Not interested in your excuses or your little games. I've got a list of winners and I'm crossing off your names. I need a man who can handle a boss like me. Not a boy who's scared of what he can't be. Someone with a plan and a fire in his soul. Someone who knows how to take control. I need a man who can stand on his own two feet. A man who's strong and won't accept defeat. Not a boy who's looking for a place to hide. I need a man with a sensual sweet heat.</div>
