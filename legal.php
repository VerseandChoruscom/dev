            <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Welcome to the Vault</h3>
            <p>
                This exclusive section provides fully licensed, pre-cleared assets ready for immediate commercial development. Our system ensures clear **music IP ownership** and **royalty-free composition** for all placeholder demos, streamlining your path to full copyright.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 2px solid #800020;">Rights & Licensing Assurance (For Industry Use)</h3>
            <p>To ensure a seamless, low-risk process for A&R and Sync partners, we offer the following guarantees for all placeholder demos:</p>

            <ul class="vault-guarantee-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>✅ Royalty-Free Composition:</strong> The instrumental and vocal placeholder track generated by Donna AI is covered by a Lifetime **Royalty-Free Commercial License**. This eliminates all recurring sync or master use fees for the underlying AI composition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>✅ Guaranteed Lyric Ownership:</strong> The **human-authored lyrics** are 100% human-authored and registered via Songbay, providing clear, verifiable intellectual property (IP) protection and ownership before any further development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>✅ Zero Future Royalties from AI:</strong> Your label/production company will never owe performance or mechanical royalties to the AI platform owner (Mobiversite/Donna AI) for the use of the demo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>✅ Simple Path to Full Copyright:</strong> Once you sign the song and re-record the music (replacing the AI vocals/instruments), the song becomes a new, fully human-authored derivative work based on our copyrighted lyrics, providing your company with full, traditional **copyright ownership** over the final master and publishing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>✅ Immediate Clearance:</strong> All material is pre-cleared for commercial development and **Sync Licensing** under the terms of our active PRO subscription. Proof of License (PoC) available instantly upon request.

            <h2>AI and Intellectual Property Policy (AI Music Licensing)</h2>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
                This policy is provided to ensure full transparency and **legal assurance for A&R supervisors, music publishers, and sync licensing partners** regarding the intellectual property rights associated with our catalog's demo recordings, specifically our stance on **AI music licensing**.
            </p>

            <h3>Section I: Core Human-Authored Work (Lyrics and Composition)</h3>
            <p>The commercial value of our catalog lies in the original, **human-authored intellectual property (IP)**.</p>
            <ol class="ai-policy-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Ownership of Lyrics:</strong> The creator retains **100% full, exclusive copyright** in all lyrics, song titles, and underlying concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proof of Registration:</strong> The creator's lyrics are formally registered with the third-party intellectual property registration service, **Songbay**, establishing a verifiable date of creation and ownership claim.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Human Contribution:</strong> The core composition (melodic structure and lyrical timing) is human-authored and directed. Copyright protection is claimed exclusively for these human contributions.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Section II: AI-Assisted Demos and Commercial Licensing</h3>
            <p>
                Certain musical demos ("AI Demos") in this catalog were created using the **Donna AI platform** solely to provide a high-quality placeholder for the human-authored lyrics.
            </p>
            <ol class="ai-policy-list" start="4">
                <li>
                    <strong>License & Commercial Rights:</strong> The instrumental track and AI vocal placeholder were generated under an active **Donna PRO Subscription**. This grants the creator a permanent, **Royalty-Free Commercial License** for the AI Demo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage Clearance (Sync/Master Use):</strong> All AI Demo elements are **pre-cleared** for commercial use, including monetization, distribution, and synchronization (Sync) licensing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Zero Future Royalties to AI Platform:</strong> The buyer (label or publisher) will **never owe performance or mechanical royalties** to the Donna AI platform or its parent company (Mobiversite) for the use of the demo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proof of Creation (PoC):</strong> A digital Proof of Creation, including the exact text prompts and settings used to generate the music, is available upon request to verify license status and creative intent.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Section III: Buyer's Path to Full Copyright</h3>
            <p>
                The terms of the Donna PRO Subscription ensure a clear and simple path for the buyer to acquire **full, unchallengeable copyright** in the final recording.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Replacement of AI Elements:</strong> All AI-generated elements, particularly the AI vocal placeholder, are intended to be **replaced** by human musicians and a human vocalist hired by the buyer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acquisition of Derivative Work:</strong> Once the buyer re-records the music and vocals, the resulting sound recording and musical work is considered a new, fully human-authored derivative work based on our copyrighted lyrics. This grants the buyer **full, traditional copyright ownership** over the final master and derivative publishing rights acquired through contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stems Provided:</strong> High-quality WAV stems of the AI instrumental track are available upon acquisition to assist the producer in mixing, editing, or adapting the track rather than starting production from scratch.
                </li>
            </ul>
