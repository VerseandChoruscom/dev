                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This playful pop/dancehall anthem, "the real dream team," celebrates loyalty, strength, and the unbreakable bond between two people. With a rhythmic, confident energy, the lyrics describe a partnership that can conquer any challenge. The imagery of a "rock" and "conquering worlds" provides a strong foundation for upbeat cinematic placements or brand campaigns focused on devotion and teamwork. This asset is perfect for music supervisors looking for an infectious, character-driven loyalty anthem.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Upbeat romantic comedy "power couple" montage 2. Commercial spot focused on partnership and reliability 3. Energetic character introduction</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
