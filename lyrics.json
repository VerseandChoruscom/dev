Thank God you're gone, 'cause they say it's darkest before the dawn.\n\n(Pre-Chorus) I'm not gonna tell you off, or spend hours tryna get you out my door. I've been that fool so many times before.

I truly don't want you back, don't come back.\n\n(Bridge) Let's get this straight now, it's all because of how you treated me. And if you're thinking of me and wondering, here's my answer: You wanna send a DM? Haha, I blocked you on all that stuff. You think I still have feelings? Haha, you're out of luck. You think I'm missing you? Haha, that ain't true. You wanna hear from me? Hahaha, nope, we're through.\n\n(Outro) My friends despise you, they're glad you're gone. I'm glad you're gone too, 'cause now I can find someone who doesn't treat me wrong. I can finally move on. Just don't bother to try and hit me up, You better think twice, 'cause that door is closed.

No.\nNot from the drugs, or from running the streets high.\nSo I'm begging you now, let's save your life. \nJust take the first step and give this a real try.\n\n\nBRIDGE\nI can no longer sit idly as your dreams pass you by. No.\nHow can you expect me to keep watching you slowly die. No-oo0\nI know there's pain, I do.\nSee the fear in my eyes, cause\nI don't want my final word to you to be a goodbye. No.\nI don't want my last time being with you is when your casket is lowered.\nWith tears streaming down my face, and screaming, \"Why?\"\nNo, no, no, I don't ever wanna say goodbye.
