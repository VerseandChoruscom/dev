    <h1>(TITLE: WILDFLOWER)</h1>

    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>Oh, she's Wildflower, dancing in the wind</p>
    <p>she's got the spirit of a rebel, never gonna bend</p>
    <p>With every step she takes, she's breaking free</p>
    <p>Oh she's a Wildflower, just watch and see</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>In a small town, with dusty roads and faded signs</p>
    <p>In a row of houses all the same design</p>
    <p>A girl named Wildflower does reside</p>
    <p>Dreaming of the day, she gets away, and leaves that old town behind</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>her Mommas light dimmed when she turned just 8, went to live with Granny cause her Daddys a inmate of the state</p>
    <p>And when she's walking</p>
    <p>the town folk be talking she pays em no mind</p>
    <p>she holds her head high with a big old smile, Wildflowers one of a kind</p>

    <h2>(BRIDGE)</h2>
    <p>Against the grain, she stands her own</p>
    <p>her spirit's so bright, she's never alone</p>
    <p>With strength in her bones, and a soul that won't break</p>
    <p>Gonna carve her path, no matter what it takes</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS REPEATS)</h2>

    <h2>(OUTRO)</h2>
    <p>you won't see her look back at the dust and doubt</p>
    <p>the only road for her is the one leading out</p>
