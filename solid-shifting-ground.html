    <h1>(TITLE: SOLID SHIFTING GROUND)</h1>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>A heart can be heavy, weighted down by dreams</p>
    <p>Like a storm cloud gathering, It silently screams</p>
    <p>A heart can be shattered, splintered on the floor</p>
    <p>Leaving you in pieces, wanting something more</p>
    <p>A flower can unfurl, a vibrant, joyful sight</p>
    <p>Kissed by golden sunshine, bathed in morning light</p>
    <p>That same flower can fade, its colors turn to gray</p>
    <p>Petals falling softly, drifting far away</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>Love can lift you higher than you've ever known</p>
    <p>Building you an empire, a comfortable throne</p>
    <p>That same love can leave you stranded in the night</p>
    <p>A hollow, empty feeling, where once burned a light</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>A friend can be a beacon, steady and so true</p>
    <p>Lending you their strength for all that you go through</p>
    <p>And another can turn on you, with a bitter sting</p>
    <p>Leaving you to wonder, what tomorrow will bring</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>But for every up there is a down, yeah It's true</p>
    <p>Like the tide that rushes in, then pulls away from you</p>
    <p>And It's worth it every time It comes around</p>
    <p>This crazy, beautiful life on solid, shifting ground</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>So hold on to the moments when you're standing tall</p>
    <p>Embrace the gentle rain when you begin to fall</p>
    <p>'Cause the darkness only makes the sunshine shine so bright</p>
    <p>Gotta feel the low to truly know the height</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS REPEATS)</h2>

    <h2>(OUTRO)</h2>
    <p>Yeah, It's worth it every time, the laughter and the tears</p>
    <p>Pushing through the shadows, conquering all your fears</p>
    <p>For every up there is a down, and that's alright</p>
    <p>we'll keep on reaching for the light, with all our might</p>
    <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, the light</p>
    <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh, with all our might</p>
