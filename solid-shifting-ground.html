                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This reflective ballad, "solid shifting ground," explores the inherent duality of human experience—the highs and lows, the fleeting nature of joy, and the resilience required to navigate change. The lyrics use powerful metaphors of shifting ground and changing tides to describe life's unpredictability. It highlights how darkness provides the contrast necessary to appreciate the light. This asset offers a profound, emotionally resonant foundation for music supervisors seeking reflective cinematic placements or storytelling sequences in emotional dramas.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Reflective character montage 2. Emotional drama midpoint 3. Storytelling sequence on life’s resilience</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h3 class="lyric-line">The sun comes up and then it goes back down</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A smile can quickly turn into a frown</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">One moment you are soaring on a cloud</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And the next you're lost within a lonely crowd</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But for every up there is a down yeah it's true</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Like the tide that rushes in then pulls away from you</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And it's worth it every time it comes around</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">This crazy beautiful life on solid shifting ground</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A love can bloom and then it starts to fade</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A promise broken that was once so truly made</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The stars they shine so bright within the night</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Then they're gone by morning where once burned a light</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A friend can be a beacon steady and so true</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Lending you their strength for all that you go through</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And another can turn on you with a bitter sting</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Leaving you to wonder what tomorrow will bring</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">So hold on to the moments when you're standing tall</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Embrace the gentle rain when you begin to fall</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause the darkness only makes the sunshine shine so bright</h3>
