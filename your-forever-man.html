            <p>Thank you for your interest in this Lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint.' If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This anthemic pop lyric, "My Words Still Matter," is a powerful exploration of self-worth and the internal victory found in silence. Kellie Larson delivers a high-value narrative asset for A&R professionals seeking character-driven sync licensing opportunities in 2026. The storytelling focuses on a protagonist who reclaims their power by choosing not to engage with someone who dismisses them. It captures the nuance of being misunderstood and the defiant confidence that comes from knowing one's value is independent of another's validation. The "drunk sinner" imagery adds a gritty, realistic edge to the empowerment theme, making it suitable for modern drama soundtracks or episodic finales. As a cinematic songwriter, Larson provides a blueprint that anchors an emotional arc with authenticity. This lyric is designed to resonate with audiences seeking "new music" that speaks to the strength of the human spirit and the quiet, fierce dignity of one's own truth.</p>
            <p><strong>This would be best:</strong> 1. Dramatic bar scene confrontation 2. Coming-of-age film empowerment arc 3. Social justice campaign soundtrack 4. Streaming series character breakdown</p>
