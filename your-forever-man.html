            <p>Thank you for your interest in this Lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint.' If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This cinematic lyric by Kellie Larson, "Your Forever Man," explores the profound psychological landscape of protective love and the journey toward healing from childhood trauma. Specifically designed for A&R music supervisors and sync placements in 2026, the narrative focuses on a protagonist who acts as an emotional anchor for a partner named Misty. The storytelling captures the transition from vulnerability and "fear and anxiety" to a state of being "finally free." It utilizes powerful weather metaphors—storms and hurricanes—to illustrate internal conflict and the strength required to weather them. This lyric provides a resonant, human-centric framework for romantic dramas or episodic finales that deal with deep emotional recovery. Larson's writing offers a polished foundation for any project seeking a narrative that anchors a soundtrack with genuine emotional weight and a lasting, hopeful impact on the audience.</p>
            <p><strong>This would be best:</strong> 1. Romantic drama emotional breakthrough 2. Healing from trauma montage 3. Character-driven streaming series finale 4. Cinematic exploration of unconditional support</p>
            <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
