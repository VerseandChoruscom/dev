    <h1 class="page-header script-text">AI and Intellectual Property Policy</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">
        This policy is provided to ensure full transparency and legal assurance for A&R supervisors, music publishers, and sync licensing partners regarding the intellectual property rights associated with our catalog's demo recordings.
    </p>

    <h2>Section I: Core Human-Authored Work (Lyrics and Composition)</h2>
    <p>The commercial value of our catalog lies in the original, human-authored intellectual property (IP).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
            <strong>Ownership of Lyrics:</strong> The creator retains **100% full, exclusive copyright** in all lyrics, song titles, and underlying concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Proof of Registration:</strong> The creator's lyrics are formally registered with the third-party intellectual property registration service, **Songbay**, establishing a verifiable date of creation and ownership claim.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Human Contribution:</strong> The core composition (melodic structure and lyrical timing) is human-authored and directed. Copyright protection is claimed exclusively for these human contributions.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section II: AI-Assisted Demos and Commercial Licensing</h2>
    <p>
        Certain musical demos ("AI Demos") in this catalog were created using the **Donna AI platform** solely to provide a high-quality placeholder for the human-authored lyrics.
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2" start="4">
        <li>
            <strong>License & Commercial Rights:</strong> The instrumental track and AI vocal placeholder were generated under an active **Donna PRO Subscription**. This grants the creator a permanent, **Royalty-Free Commercial License** for the AI Demo.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Clearance (Sync/Master Use):</strong> All AI Demo elements are **pre-cleared** for commercial use, including monetization, distribution, and synchronization (Sync) licensing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Zero Future Royalties to AI Platform:</strong> The buyer (label or publisher) will **never owe performance or mechanical royalties** to the Donna AI platform or its parent company (Mobiversite) for the use of the demo.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Proof of Creation (PoC):** A digital Proof of Creation, including the exact text prompts and settings used to generate the music, is available upon request to verify license status and creative intent.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Section III: Buyer's Path to Full Copyright</h2>
    <p>
        The terms of the Donna PRO Subscription ensure a clear and simple path for the buyer to acquire full, unchallengeable copyright in the final recording.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
            <strong>Replacement of AI Elements:</strong> All AI-generated elements, particularly the AI vocal placeholder, are intended to be **replaced** by human musicians and a human vocalist hired by the buyer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Acquisition of Derivative Work:</strong> Once the buyer re-records the music and vocals, the resulting sound recording and musical work is considered a new, fully human-authored derivative work based on our copyrighted lyrics. This grants the buyer **full, traditional copyright ownership** over the final master and derivative publishing rights acquired through contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stems Provided:</strong> High-quality WAV stems of the AI instrumental track are available upon acquisition to assist the producer in mixing, editing, or adapting the track rather than starting production from scratch.
        </li>
    </ul>
