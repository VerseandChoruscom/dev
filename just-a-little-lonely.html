                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> "just a little sorry" is a powerful narrative lyric by cinematic songwriter Kellie Larson. It captures the raw vulnerability of watching a partner return after a betrayal, only to realize that the cost of their "freedom" was the destruction of the relationship. The song evolves from deep grief to a soulful surrender to "god and fate," concluding with a sense of personal liberation. This asset is ideal for music supervisors looking for evocative, high-stakes relationship drama and themes of female empowerment and healing.</p>

            <h3 class="lyric-line">Streetlights paint a lonely picture on my wall</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Each car that passes I'm always hoping it's your call</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just saw you out the window a shadow in the night</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Pacing back and forth beneath the pale moonlight</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you ask me why with a question in your eyes</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Do you think it was fair to throw this all aside</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Do you believe it was just</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Which one of us do you think of most</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">While you're out there begging in the bitter cold</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">How does it feel to destroy us</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Tell me what do you see</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Now I sit over here just crying while you're wandering free</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you say it feels like you're dying</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Are you just a little lonely or just a little sorry</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Every corner of this room holds a memory of you</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A gallery of moments just fading from the view</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm drowning in the silence the quiet is too loud</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just trying to find a silver lining in this dark rain cloud</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you ask me why with that question in your eyes</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Did you think it was fair to just throw this all aside</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Do you believe it was just or just too much</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">What are you doing while you're out there in the bitter cold</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">How does it feel to destroy us</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just tell me how could you do this to me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Now I sit over here crying while you're just wandering free</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you say it feels like you're dying</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I know</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Are you just a little lonely and just a little sorry</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Is the grass greener like you were hoping it would be or is there just a new set of problems this starts</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just trying not to stay mad playing games with broken hearts</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Remembering all the mistakes the bitter taste of blame</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Juggling the weight of betrayal and family and friends throwing shame and hate</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm just leaving whatever this is to God and Fate</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Emotional Peak)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you say it feels like you're dying</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Well maybe that's just the cost</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you thought she would take you in now look who's truly and utterly lost</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just you</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause I'm done with all the crying I'm just now finally breaking free</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Yeah I'm done with feeling lonely</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I just feel so lonely alone it's now just me</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Yeah I'm just leaving it all to God and Fate</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No more crying</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No more waiting by the window</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause it's just me now</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just a little stronger</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just a little wiser</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just free</h3>
