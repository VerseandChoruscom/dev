                <p>Thank you for your interest in this Lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint.' If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This cinematic pop ballad, "Year in the Rearview," provides a profound narrative exploration of the resilience required to overcome emotional betrayal and loss. Crafted specifically for 2026 A&R sync opportunities, the lyric follows a 365-day arc of healing, moving from the "shattering crash" of a broken relationship to the "sunlight" of self-reclamation. It utilizes powerful metaphors of fortress-building and wounded trees to illustrate the internal work of recovery. The storytelling is raw and authentic, capturing the "should haves" and "could bes" of grief before transitioning into an empowered state of freedom. This high-value asset is ideal for music supervisors seeking a resonant foundation for character-driven dramatic montages or episodic finales. Kellie Larson’s songwriting anchors the emotional weight of a soundtrack with a genuine human-centric focus, offering a polished blueprint for cinematic projects that emphasize the transition from heartbreak to a hopeful, steady future.</p>
                <p><strong>This would be best:</strong> 1. Emotional healing journey montage 2. Episodic finale dealing with closure 3. Cinematic character arc breakthrough 4. Adult contemporary drama soundtrack</p>
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h3 class="lyric-line">Three hundred sixty-five sunsets bled into the night</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Since the slammed door echoed stealing all the light</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A calendar circled each day a heavy stone</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Building this fortress standing here alone</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The ghosts of Your laughter still danced in the air</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A constant whisper a burden hard to bear</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Every shared secret a sharp little sting</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A melody broken the silence It would bring</h3>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A year in the rearview since that shattering crash</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A year just to glue the broken pieces from the ash</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Washing away the bitterness letting the hurt unwind</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Guess It will take another year to truly leave the poison behind</h3>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Sleepless hours counting cracks upon the wall</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Haunted by phone calls I refused to make at all</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Your name on a street sign a punch to the gut It brings</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Like a phantom limb aching for the touch that love once sings</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I cursed Your memory then cursed My foolish pride</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Lost in the labyrinth where broken promises hide</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The should haves and could bes a loop inside My head</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Wishing I had seen the storm clouds gathering overhead</h3>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">They say time is a healer a softly spoken lie</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">When the scars run deeper than the naked eye can spy</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">This knot in My stomach a reminder sharp and keen</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Of whispered betrayals and the love that turned unclean</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But I am peeling back layers like bark from a wounded tree</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Reclaiming the silence finally setting Me free</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">This anger is a wildfire I am letting the embers fade</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Planting new seeds now in the garden We once made</h3>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>
            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Yeah another year stretching on this open road</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Leaving Your shadow lightening My heavy load</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I am stepping into sunlight with a hopeful steady gaze</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Turning the page now on those hazy hurtful days</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A year has passed and the healing has begun to bloom</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Sweeping the darkness from this quiet room</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No more poison no more bitter sting</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just the quiet promise of what tomorrow might bring</h3>
