    <h2>Your Forever Man</h2>
    <div class="lyrics-body">
        <div class="section-label">(Verse)</div>
        When Misty cries the tears fall like rain from her eyes<br>
        And the pain buried deep inside starts to rise<br>
        With nowhere to hide
        <div class="section-label">(Verse)</div>
        When the storm subsides and the hurricane blown away her disguise<br>
        I see within her eyes strength that won't die<br>
        No longer paralyzed
        <div class="section-label">(Chorus)</div>
        She knows how much I love her and I'm always thinking of her<br>
        We'll be together forever<br>
        Misty knows I can see it in her eyes
        <div class="section-label">(Verse)</div>
        Every demon in her mind beat them down many times<br>
        I kept her safe and unharmed held tightly in my arms until we weathered through the storm
        <div class="section-label">(Outro)</div>
        I'm the anchor her helping hand<br>
        She's my future I'm her forever man<br>
        Its no surprise Misty can see that I love her

        <strong>A&R Description:</strong> Year in the Rearview is a poignant lyrical exploration of the time required to heal from emotional toxicity and the resilience found in the aftermath. The narrative follows the slow process of washing away bitterness and letting hurt unwind, using the metaphor of a long road to illustrate the distance put between the protagonist and a painful past. It captures the quiet promise of tomorrow and the gradual return of sunlight after a period of darkness. The lyrics emphasize the strength found in solitary reflection and the eventual bloom of self-empowerment. This work is ideal for cinematic placements focusing on a character's "new beginning" or the closing of a difficult chapter. By detailing the weight of a heavy load finally being lightened, the storytelling provides a relatable and hopeful arc for audiences. This cinematic lyric is designed to provide the emotional backbone for scenes that require a transition from melancholy to steady, hopeful independence.

    <h2>Year in the Rearview</h2>
    <div class="lyrics-body">
        <div class="section-label">(Verse)</div>
        Washing away the bitterness letting the hurt unwind<br>
        Guess it'll take another year to truly leave the poison behind
        <div class="section-label">(Outro)</div>
        Yeah another year stretching on this open road<br>
        Leaving your shadow lightening my heavy load<br>
        I'm stepping into sunlight with a hopeful steady gaze<br>
        Turning the page now on those hazy hurtful days<br>
        A year has passed and the healing's begun to bloom<br>
        Sweeping the darkness from this quiet room<br>
        No more poison no more bitter sting<br>
        Just the quiet promise of what tomorrow might bring
