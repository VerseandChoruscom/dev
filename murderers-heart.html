    <h1>(TITLE: MURDERER'S HEART)</h1>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>Mary and Dan in therapy sat, their marriage they tried to mend</p>
    <p>Mary gave it all her heart, but Dan, he wouldn't bend</p>
    <p>Another day, nothing changed, they fought, he left, she'd weep</p>
    <p>He made no noise when he came back home, not a knock, bang, or a peep</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>See, Mary didn't know all his secrets, and Dan wouldn't let them spill</p>
    <p>But she knew something was amiss, but was too scared to make a big deal</p>
    <p>But this one day, he acted real funny, so she tracked his phone with dread</p>
    <p>To a bar she found him laughing, with her own sister instead</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>Had a beer in one hand and the other resting on her sister's thigh he jumped out of his seat so quick</p>
    <p>Seemed to lose the ability to speak, but in his mind screaming, Oh shit</p>
    <p>Mary's world was destroyed then, but she knew what she must do</p>
    <p>Mary pulled out what her Daddy gave her, a big old Colt .22</p>

    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>Dan dropped his beer, placed that hand to shield his little man then holding on real tight, his other hand stretched out in front of him, like, What's that gonna do, right</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>And you might think she didn't even blink, before she fired one between his eyes</p>
    <p>But Mary loved Dan too much to kill him but her sister met her demise</p>
    <p>He blamed her for all their woes, he lied and wouldn't even bend</p>
    <p>Now she's got a weapon, and soon a life sentence, and this love's at its end</p>

    <h2>(BRIDGE)</h2>
    <p>He thought he was safe, in his selfish desire, But her cold justice set the whole damn scene on fire</p>

    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>He blamed her, he lied, wouldn't even bend</p>
    <p>Now she's got a weapon, and this love's at its end</p>
    <p>He thought he was safe, he thought he could outsmart</p>
    <p>But he was playing games with a murderer's heart</p>

    <h2>(OUTRO)</h2>
    <p>With her Daddy's weapon and her cold justice, she left him on the floor, whimpering low</p>
    <p>He thought he was safe, he thought he could outsmart, he didn't know, no, no, no</p>
    <p>He was playing games with a murderer's heart</p>
