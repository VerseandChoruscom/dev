                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This dark storytelling lyric, "murderer's heart," delivers a tense narrative of betrayal and vengeance. The story follows Mary and Dan, exploring the fallout of lies and infidelity that leads to a violent confrontation. With imagery of "cold justice" and a "daddy's weapon," the lyrics capture a moment of irrevocable consequence. This asset is perfect for music supervisors seeking an atmospheric, character-driven foundation for crime dramas, thriller sequences, or noir-inspired soundtracks.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Crime drama "showdown" sequence 2. Thriller soundtrack for a revenge arc 3. Atmospheric narrative for a noir film 4. Intense character-driven storytelling placement</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The night was thick and heavy like a blanket made of lead</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Mary sat there in the shadows with thoughts of Dan in her head</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He’d been lying and cheating for far too long you see</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And Mary was tired of being the one to always be</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">She’d found the letters hidden away in a box under the bed</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And every word she read felt like a bullet through her head</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Dan dropped his beer placed that hand to shield his little man then holding on real tight</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">His other hand stretched out in front of him like what's that gonna do right</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And you might think she didn't even blink before she fired one between his eyes</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But Mary loved Dan too much to kill him but her sister met her demise</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He blamed her for all their woes he lied and wouldn't even bend</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Now she's got a weapon and soon a life sentence and this love's at its end</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He thought he was safe in his selfish desire</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But her cold justice set the whole damn scene on fire</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He blamed her he lied wouldn't even bend</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Now she's got a weapon and this love's at its end</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He thought he was safe he thought he could outsmart</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But he was playing games with a murderer's heart</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">With her Daddy's weapon and her cold justice she left him on the floor whimpering low</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He thought he was safe he thought he could outsmart he didn't know no no no</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He was playing games with a murderer's heart</h3>
