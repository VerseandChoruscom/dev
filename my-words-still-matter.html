                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This anthemic pop lyric, "my words still matter," explores a nuanced empowerment arc centered on self-worth and tactical silence. The narrative captures a protagonist in a vulnerable moment—"when I'm lit"—choosing to protect their inner truth from someone who wouldn't respect it. With a confident yet restrained tone, the lyrics emphasize that internal victory is more powerful than outward shouting. This asset is an ideal foundation for music supervisors seeking an emotionally complex soundtrack for self-empowerment or internal character growth sequences.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Internal character realization sequence 2. Self-empowerment montage 3. Dramatic scene focusing on restrained strength</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I’m sitting here in this crowded room with my thoughts all in a blur</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And I can feel the weight of your gaze like a cold and heavy fur</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You think you know me you think you’ve got me all figured out</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But you don’t know the first thing about what I’m all about</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You think my silence is a sign of weakness or a lack of things to say</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But I’m just waiting for the right time to blow you all away</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">So I turn from the exit and I walk back to my seat cause I'll be the winner by protecting the drunk sinner</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Because shouting your truth is the sound of defeat and I will find my victory back at my seat</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">My words still matter even when I'm lit</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But I will keep them in my head and I just sit</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Smiling dumbly at you with more red on my teeth</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Than on my lips than on my lips</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The air is thick with the scent of gin and the sound of shallow talk</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And I can feel the pressure building like a ticking clock</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You’re looking at me like I’m some kind of exhibit in a zoo</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Like my feelings are cheap like my words are just worn</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">If the drink in my system is the reason you don't hear</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Then I'm trading my strength for a sip of your fear</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">My words still matter</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">My words still matter</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm taking back the power that you thought was yours to keep</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm sowing the seeds of a harvest that I’m gonna reap</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Yeah my words still matter</h3>
