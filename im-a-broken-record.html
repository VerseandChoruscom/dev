  <div class="lyric-line">Yeah a goddamn mess that's the headline news. Worthless ain't a feeling it's the air I choose to breathe these days. Table's set for one it's true. Surrounded by the ghosts of me and you. Their eyes like lasers judging every flaw. But middle fingers up I ain't playing by their law. Cause when I'm crashing down they won't be sticking 'round. Too busy walking off without a single sound. You can't catch a falling star when you're facing east. Always the leaver and I'm always the deceased in this damn game of hearts. So tell me who the hell cares. Your silence screams the answer in the empty air. You got your shiny life your perfect little scene. Guess being around me just makes your picture unclean.</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Cause I'm a broken record skipping on repeat</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">This ain't a cry for help it's the bitter taste of defeat</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Yeah my eyes are open now the venom starts to fade</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">I'm cutting all the ties a promise I have made</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">So watch me walk away into the fading light</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Tonight's the night I break free and finally feel alright</div>

  <div class="song-label">Verse 2</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Used to crave a touch a whisper in the dark</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Now the silence is a comfort leaving its own stark mark</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Sickening to be me well baby now you're free</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">No more heavy baggage clinging to your pedigree</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">This ain't a threat it's just the honest to god truth</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">I'm ripping out the roots of this one-sided youth</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus Repeats</div>

  <div class="song-label">Bridge</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Maybe down the road the dust will start to clear</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Maybe this heavy load won't feel so severe</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But right here right now the only way to mend</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Is to walk away and let this bitter story end</div>
