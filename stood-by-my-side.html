                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> An deeply emotional and spiritual anthem that navigates the journey from isolation and despair to hope and restoration. "stood by your side" addresses the heavy reality of feeling abandoned by the world and finding an anchor in divine love. The narrative arc moves from darkness and "whispers in the dark" to a powerful declaration of survival and peace. This track is perfectly suited for faith-based projects or cinematic moments requiring a message of profound resilience and spiritual support.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. High-impact redemption or survival sequences 2. Church worship or faith-based promotional content 3. Emotional character breakthroughs in dramatic series 4. Inward-looking montage of healing</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
