                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This dark piano ballad, "the pocket watch," explores themes of disenchantment and the haunting weight of lost time. Set against a misty waterfront, the narrative follows a protagonist sitting in isolation, comforted only by the rhythmic ticking of a former partner's watch. The lyrics delve into the heavy anxiety of a broken relationship and the paradox of unwanted freedom. This asset is an ideal choice for music supervisors looking for an evocative, melancholic foundation for emotional soundtracks or dark cinematic sequences.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Dark, emotional soundtrack for dramatic loss 2. Cinematic sequence depicting deep isolation 3. Melancholic reflection montage</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse 1)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just chilling on a bench at the waterfront</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Intrusive thoughts swimming in my head feeling drunk</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The mist slowly drifts through the trees and settles over the water making it hard to see anything but the ghost of you and me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But the reality of sitting alone here really sticks</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">My only comfort is the sound of your pocket watch as it just ticks</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Tick Tick</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just your pocket watch tick ticking away</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Counting down the moments you've been away</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Overcasting sunny days</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Every tick is a moment you been away</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse 2)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">When I look into the water it reminds me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">That the reflection isn't what it is suppose to be</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The moonlight luminates the water and the rock skips beats</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I wonder if you are also thinking of me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Tick Tick</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I wonder if you ever miss me</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse 3)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The moon casts a shadow and the darkness has weight</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Hoping my dreams will provide an escape</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The reflection is lying to me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Tick Tick</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I never wanted to be free</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Emotional Peak)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Still feeling the anxiety since the day we stopped being us and became you and me</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">It seems always to be the heaviness I can’t shake</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Through out the night I sit and listen to the tick and watch leaves fall all around softly dying as they lay quietly on the ground</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And I wonder why I ever agreed to be free</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Still waiting here</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No where else I gotta be</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Just your pocket watch</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Tick Tick</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Even though it will remain in its watery grave at the bottom of the misty sea the tick tick will always haunt me tick tick</h3>
