                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> A visceral and high-stakes cinematic lyric, "pierce me through the heart" captures the harrowing reality of domestic volatility and the explosive decision to escape. The narrative moves from the crushing weight of "fists" and "insults" to the powerful realization that self-preservation is the only way out. It features a high-impact transition from victim to survivor, ending with a gritty, rock-infused goodbye. This asset is ideal for music supervisors looking for an authentic, intense soundtrack for domestic thrillers or survival-themed dramas.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Intense escape or "leaving for good" sequences 2. Character realization montage in a gritty drama 3. Trailer for a domestic thriller or revenge film 4. High-impact final act credits</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
