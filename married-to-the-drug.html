                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint'. If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> This intense cinematic lyric, "married to the drug," explores the harrowing reality of loving someone lost to addiction. Using visceral imagery—"signed the papers in white powder" and "black widow"—it personifies the drug as a rival spouse. The narrative moves from the suffocation of being an "energy drain" to a powerful climax of liberation, where the protagonist reclaims their soul. This asset is a high-impact choice for music supervisors looking for gritty, authentic storytelling for crime dramas or recovery-themed sequences.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. Gritty drama "breaking point" sequence 2. Addiction-themed narrative montage 3. Intense character realization/liberation scene 4. Dark, atmospheric cinematic soundtrack</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I watch you chase the ghost of a high you'll never reach</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A siren song that’s leading you further out from the beach</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Into a dark and lonely place where the sun don’t ever shine</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">And you’re leaving me here waiting on the other side of the line</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The empty bottles and the needles they’re the icons of your blues</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A mysterious gaping void where nothing good accrues</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Married to the drug Mrs. Fetty hand in hand</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Signed the papers in white powder you’re a submissive man</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">She’s a black widow demanding your life</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You made your choice now leave my light</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause you're the energy drain the life-sucker the weight</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You leave me breathless flatlined left an empty state</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You left me hollowed out and frail a November pumpkin</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Your lake of fire floats every sin</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You move like a ghost a viper a creature of the night</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">A parasite sucking me dry body twisted at the corner light</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You thought you had me trapped here in your cycle of take and spend</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But this is where your shadow shrinks this is where my misery ends</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I’m cutting down the tree shade that kept me in the cold</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I’m reclaiming the pieces of the soul that you stole</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus Repeats)</h2>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The door is slammed the lock is turned I'm standing tall</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">You can't steal my future you can't have it all</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Go back to your mistress let her have what's left</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm choosing life and leaving you to your self-made theft</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Leaving you to your self-made theft</h3>
