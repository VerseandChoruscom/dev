    <h1>(TITLE: MARRIED TO THE DRUG)</h1>
    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>Why did you knock on my life's door</p>
    <p>What did you come here for</p>
    <p>Always on survival mode, a game you shouldn't have played</p>
    <p>I don't need a friend who's a fiend, a leech, a Tree Shade</p>
    <p>Condemnation, no compensation—that's your calling card</p>
    <p>You kept your promises brittle, your word a flimsy lie</p>
    <p>And that smirk when you watched me break and cry</p>
    <p>You don't know the first thing 'bout honesty, or keeping things true</p>
    <p>Just a serious, gaping void where nothing good accrues</p>
    <h2>(CHORUS)</h2>
    <p>Married to the drug, Mrs. Fetty, hand in hand</p>
    <p>Signed the papers in white powder, you’re a submissive man</p>
    <p>She’s a black widow, demanding your life</p>
    <p>You made your choice, now leave my light</p>
    <p>'Cause you're the energy drain, the life-sucker, the weight</p>
    <p>You leave me breathless, flatlined, left an empty state</p>
    <h2>(VERSE)</h2>
    <p>You left me hollowed out and frail, a November pumpkin</p>
    <p>Your lake of fire floats every sin</p>
    <p>You move like a ghost, a viper, a creature of the night</p>
    <p>A parasite sucking me dry, body twisted at the corner light</p>
    <h2>(BRIDGE)</h2>
    <p>You thought you had me trapped here, in your cycle of take and spend</p>
    <p>But this is where your shadow shrinks, this is where my misery ends</p>
    <p>I’m cutting down the Tree Shade that kept me in the cold</p>
    <p>I’m reclaiming the pieces of the soul that you stole</p>
    <h2>(CHORUS REPEATS)</h2>
    <h2>(OUTRO)</h2>
    <p>The door is slammed, the lock is turned, I'm standing tall</p>
    <p>You can't steal my future, you can't have it all</p>
    <p>No more fiending around me</p>
    <p>I can finally breathe, the air is clean been choking since the day we met</p>
    <p>Finally free</p>
    <p>So, go on hide in that shadow, be that Tree Shade</p>
    <p>Your hold on me is broken</p>
    <p>Your dark price is paid</p>
