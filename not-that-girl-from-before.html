                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> "not that girl from before" is a poignant and powerful narrative lyric by cinematic songwriter Kellie Larson. It depicts the precise moment of psychological shift where a victim of emotional manipulation and gaslighting reclaims their strength. Moving from the quiet anxiety of "shallow breaths" to the active reclamation of "changing locks," the song serves as a visceral anthem for personal liberation. Ideal for music supervisors seeking high-stakes character development music or gritty domestic dramas exploring the theme of standing one's ground.</p>

            <h3 class="lyric-line">Not that girl from before</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Laying still in bed with shallow short breaths while you are creeping around</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Praying you'd think I'm asleep not making a sound</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">So your stored guilt doesn't start a fight and make my soul a battleground</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Okay I am up and yes I heard you</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Please just stop</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Why so cruel</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Leave my heart alone what did I ever do so bad to you</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you'd just accuse me of everything throw lies and deflect</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Blaming me for every damn thing all your misfortune and making up events</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Fighting with you is so frustrating</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you play your sick games pulling me into the fray</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Staying out all night getting comfort some other way</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Used to cry those tears but the river don't flow no more cause I'm not the girl you used to know from before</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you won't break me down you won't tear me up again</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I'm done with your empty promises and every way you pretend</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you're not good for me nope and the truth is plain to see</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">So it's time to move on don't you stop don't look back just get gone</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Cause I don't want you you're not welcome anymore</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">While you're doing nada kicking rocks I'm taking out trash busy changing locks</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Shhh don't you say a word there's nothing new to say</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Nothing I haven't heard so just get on your way</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Go find another place to stay</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Yeah I want less talk and more walk baby we are through</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">your excuses hit a dead end at my door</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">I've memorized every word of this old score</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you don't deserve me yeah the truth is clear to see</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">So it's time to move on don't you stop don't look back just get gone</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">you ain't worth a lick yeah I don't need you anymore</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Emotional Peak)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Down the road when the dust has settled don't bother hitting me up</h3>
