    <div class="lyric-line">Where did you go?</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Why did you leave me here?</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">In our home, I'm just breathing in fear.</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Come back, please; it's so lonely, I wish you were near.</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I'm all alone, drowning in a sea of tears.</div>

    <div class="song-label">Verse 1</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Every memory, a vivid scene, playing in my head:</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Laughter, and kisses, all the sweet words we said.</div>

    <div class="song-label">Bridge</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Sometimes I feel you're beside me, and I reach out my hand—</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But reality crashes from your absence, up to my head in sinking sand.</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">So tell me, how do I move forward, when I can't even stand?</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">When all our dreams are gone and I'm left alone in this barren land.</div>
