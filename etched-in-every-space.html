[Intro]
Where did you go?
Why did you leave me here?
In our home, I'm just breathing in fear.
Come back, please; it's so lonely, I wish you were near.
I'm all alone, drowning in a sea of tears.
Every memory, a vivid scene, playing in my head:
Laughter, and kisses, all the sweet words we said.
Your smile, your laugh, the stories that went for days.
I loved how silly you were, lost in a sleepy daze.
Oh, I miss your stupid face! It’s etched in every space.
When I called out your name, you always came, my steady flame.
I loved when you listened intensely to every word I’d say,
And when you'd kiss my shoulder, the whole world would melt away.
Now you're gone, I know, and I'll never be the same.
All this stress and anxiety, a fire burning in my veins.
My heart shattered, just calling out your name,
Knowing that I'll never be able to touch you again.
Another memory, a vivid scene, playing in my head:
That face you made before you kissed me, and all the sweet words we said.
Your quirky smile, how you'd chortle when you'd laugh, your stories that went for days,
I loved how silly you were, lost in a sleepy daze.

Oh, I miss your stupid face! It’s etched in every space.
When I called out your name, you always came, my steady flame.
I loved when you listened intensely to every word I’d say,
And when you'd kiss my shoulder, the whole world would melt away.

Sometimes I feel you're beside me, and I reach out my hand—
But reality crashes from your absence, up to my head in sinking sand.
So tell me, how do I move forward, when I can't even stand?
When all our dreams are gone and I'm left alone in this barren land.

Oh, I miss your stupid face! It’s etched in every space.
When I called out your name, you always came, my steady flame.
I loved when you listened intensely to every word I’d say,
And when you'd kiss my shoulder, the whole world would melt away.
[Outro]
You're gone. And I'm still here.
In our home, filled with my tears. I miss you. I miss you so much.
Alone... alone...
