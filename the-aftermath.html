    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="desc-text">
        "The Aftermath" is a gritty, emotional Alt-Rock ballad exploring the withdrawal symptoms of a toxic relationship. The protagonist struggles with the "suffocating quiet" after years of being "hooked on the drama." The lyrics traverse the journey from craving the chaos to finding clarity in the silence. It culminates in a powerful explosion of realization ("NO MORE REWINDING"), transforming the silence from a dread into a promise of freedom. Ideal for scenes of psychological recovery or the final turning point in a breakup arc.

    <h2>Licensing & AI Disclosure</h2>
    <div class="desc-text">
        Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint.' If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.

    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">Can't breathe in this quiet</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Not used to the silence</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Hooked on the drama, the raw violence</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Of us, a destructive defiance</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">This empty space just screams your name</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">A gaping void where chaos once held flame</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">My days stretch out, a hollow hum</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Where'd the noise go? Why's it numb?</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">So I hit play, spend my day</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Rewinding, reliving, come what may</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Good times just flickered, a cruel tease</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I paused, on my knees, begging for ease</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Still searching, a desperate plea</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But the bad times drown me, pushing through me</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">A torrent of pain, a relentless tide</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide</div>

    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">This suffocating quiet, a heavy shroud</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Drowning out thoughts, screaming too loud</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Ghosts of arguments, a spectral fight</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Haunting me, day and through the night</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Each memory a thorn, a bitter sting</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">The broken promises, the cruel words you'd fling</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I used to crave that familiar ache, the twisted bind</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Found bizarre comfort in the chaos left behind</div>

    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">The silence whispers, "You're finally free,"</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But the echoes still bind me to what used to be</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">A part of me clings to the hurt, the known</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Afraid of this journey, stepping out alone</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But even the quiet can start to reveal</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">A strength I forgot, a way to truly feel</div>

    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">So I hit play, spend my day</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Rewinding, reliving, come what may</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Good times just flickered, a cruel tease</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I paused, on my knees, begging for ease</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Still searching, a desperate plea</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But the bad times drown me, pushing through me</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">A torrent of pain, a relentless tide</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I don't want to run, I don't want to hide</div>

    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">This suffocating quiet, a heavy shroud</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Drowning out thoughts, screaming too loud</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Ghosts of arguments, a spectral fight</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Haunting me, day and through the night</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Each memory a thorn, a bitter sting</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">The broken promises, the cruel words you'd fling</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I used to crave that familiar ache, the twisted bind</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Found bizarre comfort in the chaos left behind</div>

    <h2>Bridge</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">With every breath, every single second spent</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Dragging me down to this living torment</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">But the anger burns, a purifying fire</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Fueling my escape from this toxic mire</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Yeah, the anger burns, a purifying fire</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I'm fueling my escape, higher and higher!</div>

    <h2>Climax</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">NO MORE REWINDING, I'LL STOP THE PLAY!</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">NO MORE RELIVING, come what may!</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Good times so few, I'll leave them behind</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">No longer struggling, a new peace I'll find</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">No longer searching for what wasn't real</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">The bad times too many, now I start to heal!</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">No pain, no tide, I'll find my own solace, I no longer need to hide!</div>

    <h2>Outro</h2>
    <div class="lyric-line">The truth breaks through, bitter and clear, Reclaiming my strength, shaking off the fear</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">The silence now? A promise, not a dread, A wide-open space for what's next instead</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">I'll rise strong and new</div>
    <div class="lyric-line">Finally free, forever done with you. Everyone was right... you weren't worth the fight</div>
