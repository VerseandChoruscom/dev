  <div class="song-title">HOW'S IT FEEL, BRO?</div>

  <div class="song-label">Intro</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Yo</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You're always spinning that shit but I'm boomeranging it back and like glue it sticks</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">How's it feel bro</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You earned this one</div>

  <div class="song-label">Verse 1</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Before you dip it’s now your turn</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Don’t tell me you didn't make it home cause you fell asleep in the car</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">That weak line I've already heard before</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Then find out you never slept cause all night long you were creeping</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You can't run on empty if you fill up the tank before you go</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">And the weather is flawless no downpour or snow</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You're just like all the others always hanging with your bros</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But getting all hostile when it's me though</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You're always spinning that shit but I'm boomeranging it back and like glue it sticks</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">How's it feel bro</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You earned this one</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Yeah how's it feel bro</div>

  <div class="song-label">Verse 2</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Coming home at dawn cause the front tire was flat</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">With a spare and a jack that excuse is totally whack</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">It's super easy when it's over just come home</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Don't want to hear you couldn't call cause the battery was dead</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Use your friends instead</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Yeah use your friends instead</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus Repeats</div>

  <div class="song-label">Bridge</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Don't want to hear you don't talk to other girls that’s foolish to say</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Remember when we met you had a girl then too</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But you were talking to me all day</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Yeah you were talking to me all day</div>

  <div class="song-label">Verse 3</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You're always getting all hot being all mad</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Like I'm the one who’s doing something bad</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Even my shadow is standing different while I’m calling out your future admissions</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Covering all the bases knowing you're allergic to good decisions</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">I'm just watching it now from the outside looking in</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">And I'm calling out every place that you have been</div>

  <div class="song-label">Outro</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">So I don't want to hear that you won't do it again</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">History repeats so we know you will</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">That's how it's always been</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">You earned this one</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">How's it feel bro</div>
