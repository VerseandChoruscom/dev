  <div class="song-label">Verse 1</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">On the streets of Amsterdam she hummed a little tune</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Rejoicing in the feeling almost half past noon</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">She hurries to her love her surprise can't wait a day</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Passing on the chit-chat from the people in her way</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">No wicked storm will stop her or raging waters too</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">No earthquake or tornado firestorm or monsoon</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Oh poor lil' Belle at the bottom of the wishing well</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Her secret finally told and then her lover turned bold</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But don't you fret she's got a mighty hold</div>

  <div class="song-label">Verse 2</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Before she reached the well she prepared what she would tell</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But the surprise was for her as he confessed another lover</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">She cried and then she screamed but no one saw the scene</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">When she turned away he lunged and they both took the plunge</div>

  <div class="song-label">Bridge</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">He didn't get away as he also fell</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Ending up beside her at the bottom of the well</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">They both saw red and wanted each other dead</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">In a terrible mess they lay motionless</div>

  <div class="song-label">Chorus</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">No wicked storm will stop her or raging waters too</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">No earthquake or tornado firestorm or monsoon</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Oh poor lil' Belle at the bottom of the wishing well</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Her secret finally told and then her lover turned bold</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">But he didn't expect she would grip with such a mighty hold</div>

  <div class="song-label">Outro</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">He didn't trip nothing could loosen her grip</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">She's stuck like glue and both their wishes came true</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">Oh what a mess they lay motionless</div>
  <div class="lyric-line">At the bottom of the wishing well</div>
