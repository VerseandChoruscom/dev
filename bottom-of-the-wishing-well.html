            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">On the streets of Amsterdam she hummed a little in her malfulous voice it's almost time to rejoice</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">She's meeting her man at half past noon</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">She must hurry to meet her love as it can't wait another day</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">She passes on the chit chat from the people in her way</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No wicked storm will stop her or raging waters too</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No earthquake or tornado no firestorm or monsoon</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Before she gets to the wishing well she prepares herself on what she will tell</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">The surprise though will be on her cause he has another lover</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Oh poor lil Belle at the bottom of the wishing well</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Her secret she finally told and then her lover turned bold</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But don't fret cause she's got a mighty hold</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Verse)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He spoke his truth she yelled then screamed</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">No one was around to witness the scene</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But he doesn't get away as he also fell and ended up at the bottom of the wishing well</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Chorus)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Oh poor lil Belle at the bottom of the wishing well</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Her secret she finally told and then her lover turned bold</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">But he didn't expect she would grip with such a mighty hold</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Bridge)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">He went to lunge and they took a plunge</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">They both saw red and wanted each other dead</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Both of their wishes came true</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Oh what a mess they lay motionless at the bottom of the wishing well</h3>

            <h2 class="section-label">(Outro)</h2>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">At the bottom of the wishing well</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">Lil Belle</h3>
            <h3 class="lyric-line">In the wishing well</h3>
