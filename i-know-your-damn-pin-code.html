                <p>Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/ musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">Description:</span> A high-impact, aggressive anthem exploring the moment of digital discovery and the shift from betrayal to empowerment. Using the specific imagery of a "pin code" and "bullets for a gun named Justice," this track is designed for gritty modern dramas or high-energy scenes where a character takes back control through hard evidence. It blends the raw energy of Crunk Punk with a cinematic hard rock edge.</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold-label">This would be best:</span> 1. High-stakes confrontation scenes 2. Montage of uncovering secrets 3. Aggressive "walking away" sequence 4. Modern crime or relationship drama trailers</p>
                
                <p>Again, thank you for your interest. If any licensing questions or purchasing inquiries contact Songbay if you are a member or Kellie Larson directly at contact info below.</p>
