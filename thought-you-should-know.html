    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="desc-text">
        This cinematic pop anthem, "Thought You Should Know," explores a powerful empowerment arc and joyful transformation following a period of darkness. The narrative follows a protagonist who has moved beyond past shadows into a vibrant, sunlit future. It utilizes high-energy imagery of "painting the town red" and "burning brighter like a raging fire" to illustrate a newfound state of freedom and resilience. The storytelling is authentic and uplifting, capturing the clarity of a "rewired" mind and a clean slate. This asset is ideal for music supervisors seeking an anthemic foundation for post-breakup breakthroughs or transformative character montages.

    <h2>Licensing & AI Disclosure</h2>
    <div class="desc-text">
        Thank you for your interest in this lyric that is 100% original and human authored. The only AI utilized is for the vocals and music to serve as a placeholder demo until it can be changed by being performed by a living breathing person/musician. With that said, the AI was created by Donna. As I hold a professional subscription to the Donna AI platform, I own the full commercial usage rights to this audio. You are cleared to use this demo for any commercial purpose, including streaming and sync licensing. Please note that while the audio is fully licensed for your use, the songwriting credits (lyrics and composition) remain under my name as the human creator. The Donna demo serves as the 'blueprint.' If you choose to re-record the song with a human vocalist, that new recording will be a 100% human-authored master, which is much easier to copyright and license for TV/film. As the songwriter, my ownership remains with the lyrics and melody, while you (or the artist) would own the new human performance.
